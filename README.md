With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

We are going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:

pulls_2011-2013.csvcontains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.

pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.

pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

The first file contains the information about the pull requests that were created in the first half of the year 2011. The second file contains the information about the pull requests that were created in the second half of the year 2011. The third file contains the information about the files that were modified by each pull request.

The second file contains the information about the pull requests that were created in the first half of the year 2014. The third file contains the information about the pull requests that were created in the second half of the year 2014. The fourth file contains the information about the files that were modified by each pull request.

The third file contains the information about the files that were modified by each pull request.

DataCamp helped me a lot through this project. I learned a lot from the DataCamp course, and I learned a lot from the DataCamp community. 

Thanks you all for your support!
